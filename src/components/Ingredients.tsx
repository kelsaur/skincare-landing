            <h1>Nordic ingredients. Lab precision.</h1>
            <p>
              In the North, skin learns to live with extremes: dry air, cold
              light, long dark winters. LUMI skin lab starts there. We work with
              mosses, berries and marine extracts that naturally thrive in harsh
              climates - ingredients rich in antioxidants, minerals and lipids
              that help skin stay resilient. Every formula is built on a short
              list of natural or organic Nordic botanicals, combined with
              clinically studied actives like peptides and barrier-supporting
              humectants. No unnecessary fragrance, no crowded INCI lists - just
              what your skin needs to repair, hydrate and glow at its own pace.
