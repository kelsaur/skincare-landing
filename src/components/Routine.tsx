            <h1>A quiet ritual for every day.</h1>
            <h2>
              We design routines that are simple enough to stick to, and potent
              enough to matter. Each LUMI skin lab product has a clear role -
              cleanse, treat, seal - so you can build a ritual that fits into
              real life, not the other way around.
            </h2>
            <h3>Morning</h3>
            <p>
              Gently cleanse to wake the skin, then apply PEPTIDE SERUM 31 on
              clean, slightly damp skin. Finish with a moisturizer and SPF. The
              peptides and moss extract help support firmness and hydration
              throughout the day.
            </p>
            <h3>Evening</h3>
            <p>
              After cleansing, use PEPTIDE SERUM 31 as your treatment step,
              followed by a richer cream or face oil to lock in moisture
              overnight. Keep the rest of your routine minimal on serum nights -
              your skin doesn't need more, it needs consistency.
            </p>

              One routine, a few precise steps, repeated every day. That’s where
              the real transformation happens.
