              Gently cleanse to wake the skin, then apply PEPTIDE SERUM 31 on
              clean, slightly damp skin. Finish with a moisturizer and SPF. The
              peptides and moss extract help support firmness and hydration
              throughout the day.

              After cleansing, use PEPTIDE SERUM 31 as your treatment step,
              followed by a richer cream or face oil to lock in moisture
              overnight. Keep the rest of your routine minimal on serum nights -
              your skin doesn't need more, it needs consistency.
